ESFluent API
============

The key components of the API are :class:`~es_fluent.filters.Filter`
and :class:`~es_fluent.builder.QueryBuilder`.

Each ``Filter`` inherirts from :class:`~es_fluent.filters.Filter` and
generally provides a ``to_query`` method that prepares it for
json-serialization.

The :class:`~es_fluent.builder.QueryBuilder` manages the top-level body
of the query sent to elasticsearch. Besides composing filters, it allows
configuration of sorting, size, fields and whether the source document is
included in results.
